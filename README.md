# Short Manual of the Software

This is an internal repository containing the Iterative Particle analysis software introduced in *Link to paper*

# Authors

The software was mainly developed by Jannik Guckel with some support of Daesung Park.

## Dependencies

The Script is fully written in Python 3 (v 3.9), used of mostly using standard libraries and OpenCV (v 4.5)
it requires the following packages in order to be ran:

+ [*PIL*](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
+ [*hyperspy*](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-doc/current/user_guide/install.html)
+ [*numpy*](https://numpy.org/install/)
+ [*matplotlib*](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index)
+ glob (python core library)
+ [*scipy*](https://scipy.org/install/) 
+ ast (python core library)
+ csv (python core library)
+ os (python core library)
+ shutil (python core library)
+ [*openCV*](https://opencv.org/releases/)

## Installation and Using the program

Assuming Python3 and the above mentioned libraries are installed, the only installation step needed should be downloading the code provided by this repository without changing the local folder structure.
The program can then be executed in the terminal by using:

```
cd *local direction of this folder*
python3 iterative_particle_analyzer.py
```
